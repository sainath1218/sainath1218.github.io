Titanic Analysis

1. Problem Space (Clarification of the Problem Space)
What: The goal of this project is to analyze the Titanic dataset to identify factors that influenced passenger survival during the tragic sinking of the ship in 1912.
Why: Understanding these factors provides insights into historical decisions and survival patterns, which can have educational value and relevance for disaster management studies.
Who: This analysis is useful for historians, sociologists, and educators interested in understanding human behavior in disaster scenarios.
Where: The data focuses on passengers aboard the RMS Titanic, a transatlantic ocean liner.
When: The dataset covers the period of the ship's voyage in 1912.

2. Questions to Address through Data Analysis
What was the survival rate of passengers on the Titanic?
How did gender affect survival rates?
Was there a significant difference in survival rates among different passenger classes (Pclass)?
Did the age of passengers influence their chances of survival?
Were passengers who embarked from different ports (Embarked) more or less likely to survive?
What was the correlation between having family members on board (SibSp and Parch) and survival rates?

3. Understanding of Dataset
Data Source: The Titanic dataset is publicly available on Kaggle and contains detailed information about the passengers aboard the RMS Titanic.

Dataset Description: The dataset includes fields such as:
Survived: Survival status (1 = Survived, 0 = Did not survive).
Pclass: Passenger class (1st, 2nd, or 3rd).
Sex: Gender of the passenger.
Age: Age of the passenger.
SibSp and Parch: Number of family members onboard.
Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).

Dataset Relevance:
The dataset provides all the necessary variables to analyze factors influencing survival rates, such as gender, age, passenger class, and family relationships
